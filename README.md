# Animus
Android diary application. As of right now the purpose is to learn techonlogies within the Android world. There are some things I would like to incorporate given the time.

# Features
Users have the option to write in .txt files as well as save images and audio recording in .png and .mpeg. There is also a tagging option using xml to keep track of meta data.

# Current objectives (entries)
- Make use of inheritance and insure that NewEntry and ChosenEntry both extend one class that handles basic Entry functionality.
- Bring all other classses up to par and insure they all subclass Activity_Base. 
- Make sure all classes are using the new class <CustomAttributes> to store all UI Preferences and retrieve all color instances.
- Make sure all settings work.
