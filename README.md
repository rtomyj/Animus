# Animus
Android diary application. As of right now the purpose is to learn techonlogies within the Android world. There are some things I would like to incorporate given the time.

# Features
Users have the option to write in .txt files as well as save images and audio recording in .png and .mpeg. There is also a tagging option using xml to keep track of meta data.

# Current objectives (main_activities)
For this project a "main_activity" is an activity that uses a navigation side-bar as well as a recyclerview and its adapter. There are two base classes that all "main_activities use. Activity_A extends AppCompat and handles password scheme.MainActivity extends Activtity_A and handles saving states from bundle as well as init recyclerview and its components. All "main_activities" are sub classes of MainActivity.
The list of potential "main_activities" are;
- Domus
- Pictures
- Tags
- Faves
