# Animus
Android diary application. As of right now the purpose is to learn techonlogies within the Android world. There are some things I would like to incorporate given the time.

# Features
Users have the option to write in .txt files as well as save images and audio recording in .png and .mpeg. There is also a tagging option using xml to keep track of meta data.

# Current objectives (v2.3)
Trying to use good OO-Principles. This was my first App. My first project outside of a class and I was just excited to be able to do things on a device! Now I'm forced to take a back seat on what I want and do what I need. 
-- Make things reusable
-- Documentation
-- Delete unneccessary objects/resources/etc
-- Trim processing time and RAM usage by using less objects or making their life shorter
